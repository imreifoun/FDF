## Introduction

The FdF project focuses on creating a wireframe representation of a landscape using the provided elevation data. By connecting the points with lines, you can visualize the terrain in a 3D space. This project challenges your understanding of graphics programming concepts, such as projections, transformations, and rendering.

## Features

The FdF project includes the following key features:

- **Wireframe Rendering:** Generate a wireframe representation of a landscape using elevation data.
- **Projections:** Implement different projection techniques to display the landscape from various perspectives.
- **Color Mapping:** Assign colors to the wireframe based on the elevation or other criteria, enhancing the visual representation.
- **User Interaction:** Allow users to navigate and interact with the 3D landscape, enabling zooming, panning, and rotating views.
- **File Parsing:** Read and parse input files containing elevation data to construct the landscape.

## Installation

To install and run FdF on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/imreifoun/fdf.git
   ```

2. Change to the project directory.
   ```shell
   cd fdf
   ```

3. Compile the project using the provided Makefile.
   ```shell
   make
   ```

4. Run the FdF program, providing a landscape file as an argument.
   ```shell
   ./fdf path/to/landscape_file
   ```

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies and libraries installed on your system. Refer to the project documentation for specific requirements.


We appreciate your efforts in making the FdF project even more impressive and engaging!
